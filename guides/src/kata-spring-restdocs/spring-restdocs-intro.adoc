[spring-rest-docs]
= Spring REST Docs
Document RESTful services by combining hand-written documentation with auto-generated snippets produced with Spring MVC Test.

[Swagger vs Spring-restdocs]
= Swagger vs Spring-restdocs
== Swagger Advantages
. Documentation of methods, parameters and models are tightly integrated into the server code, allowing APIs to always stay in sync.
. Deploying, managing and using APIs with Swagger is easy.
. Provides a Web UI which makes it easy to interact with API's.
. Provides a quick way to edit the schema of the payload and an easy way to display and alter query parameter (when required).
. Supports different types of authentication and endpoint resource grouping.
. Many plugins for integrating Swagger with your language/framework of choice.Swagger implementation is available in Scala, Java and HTML5.
. Client code generators are available for Scala, Java, Javascript, Ruby, PHP, and Actionscript 3.
. Provides intuitive editors with a live console preview allowing you to see exactly what the end product will look like as you are creating and editing your file.
. Good community support, active swagger google group.
. Adding dependency jars in build script is enough.

== Swagger Disadvantages
. Swagger doesn't support hypermedia (Level 3 maturity model)
. Swagger documentation does not capture all scenarios for an API.
. Documentation is a bit lacking, errors are difficult to interperate. This leads to a larger learning curve than some other tools.
. Swagger documentation is done through several annotations which are added in your implementation classes.
. API Implementation code overtime, gets overwhelmed with swagger annotations.
. Documentation is URI centric.
. Documentation and API could be out-of-sync overtime as there are no validations in place to verify correctness of API.

== Spring REST Docs Advantages
. API descriptions and explanation are done in separate .adoc files
. Ability to structure your documentation based on domain model rather than by URI's
. asciidoctor code snippets are generated using Spring Mvc Test, which in turn are plugged into adoc files
. Guarantees that API documentation and implementation code are always in-sync.
. Any updates to request, response payloads will fail Unit Tests, until documentation is updated to reflect the changes. Forces you to update documentation for any implementation changes.
. Ability to document with different payloads and explain different test scenarios
.

== Spring REST Docs Disadvantages
. Doesn't have built-in client to interact with API's.
. Apart from adding dependency jars, need to configure where snippets should be generated and tell asciidoctor about the snippets directory in build script.

== Add Dependency JARs

Add the following code to the build script:
[source,groovy,indent=0]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourcedir}/solution/mysvc/build.gradle[tags=dependency-spring-restdocs]
----

== Spring REST Docs configuration

.ApiDocumentation.java
----
include::{sourcedir}/solution/mysvc/src/test/java/msvcdojo/ApiDocumentation.java[tags=rest-docs-config]
----
<1> Hook for linking JUnit and Spring REST Docs for generating snippets
<2> REST Docs snippet Result Handler for formatting result to tables
<3> Configuration for _RestDocumentationResultHandler_
<4> Hook for linking Spring Mvc Test to Spring REST Docs
<5> Generates asciidoc snippets for curl-request, http-request, http-response, response-fields adoc files

== asciidoctor Configuration
[source, groovy, indent=0]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourcedir}/solution/mysvc/build.gradle[tags=asciidoctor-config]

<1> Define where snippets would be generated
<2> Teach test task about snippets directory for gradle to know that when tests are run, snippets are generated in this directory
<3> Tell asciidoctor about the snippets directory for generating live documentation in the process of gradle continuous builds

== Document APIs using Spring REST Docs

A sample kata service with resources - Accounts and Contact. +
Accounts can have many Contacts. A given contact can belong to many Accounts



[[resources-index]]
== Index
The index provides the entry point into the service.

[[resources-index-access]]
=== Accessing the index
A `GET` request is used to access the index

==== Response structure

[[resources-account]]
== Account
The Account resources

[[resources-account-list]]
=== Listing Accounts
A `GET` request will list all of the service's accounts.

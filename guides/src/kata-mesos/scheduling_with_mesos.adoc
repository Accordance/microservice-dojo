== Scheduling Application in Mesos with Marathon

WARNING: In this Kata we're going to use single-machine Mesos deployment to
learn about Mesos platform. This type of a deployment provides full Mesos
functionality without resiliency for platform failures. Do not use single-machine
deployment in production!

=== Launching Mesos Cluster with Marathon framework

TIP: Make sure that the Docker machine has enough resources to run Mesos

It can help to add more resources to your Docker-machine
[source,text,options="nowrap"]
....
$ docker-machine create -d virtualbox --virtualbox-memory2048--virtualbox-cpu-count2dev
....

In the `kata-mesos/solution1` directory run:
[source,text,options="nowrap"]
....
$ C:\Dev\accordance\microservice-dojo\kata-mesos\solution1>docker_rack exec mesos:start
Executing 'mesos:start'
Starting: /kata-mesos/solution1/container_templates/mesos_master.erb.yml
Starting: /kata-mesos/solution1/container_templates/zookeeper.yml
Starting: /kata-mesos/solution1/container_templates/mesos_slave.erb.yml
Starting: /kata-mesos/solution1/container_templates/mesos_marathon.erb.yml
....

Validate that you have all the containers running:
[source,text,options="nowrap"]
....
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                          NAMES
e8fa3e206f37        mesosphere/marathon:v0.11.1    mesos_marathon
034b6f341ccf        redjack/mesos-slave:0.21.0     mesos_slave
72cc80b78a75        redjack/mesos-master:0.21.0    mesos_master
dd487551c190        jplock/zookeeper:3.4.6         zookeeper
....

=== Scheduling a Job using Marathon

Scheduling an application with Marathon:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
POST /v2/apps/mysvcdojo/staging/hello
include::{sourcedir}/solution1/hello.json[]
----

This is how you can do it from command line:
[source,text,options="nowrap"]
....
$ curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data @hello.json http://dockerhost:8282/v2/apps
....

==== Adding Healthcheck

It is possible to have Mesos to execute health-checks against your application and
restart it automatically in case the your application will not respond properly
to the health-checks.

You can add the following block to your application descriptor:

[source,json,indent=0]
....
"healthChecks": [
  {
     "path": "/health",
     "protocol": "HTTP",
     "portIndex": 0,
     "gracePeriodSeconds": 300,
     "intervalSeconds": 60,
     "timeoutSeconds": 20,
     "maxConsecutiveFailures": 3
  }
]
....

The health-checks should return:
* 200 - to indicate that everything is OK
* 503 - if there is something wrong

==== Scale the application

Increase a number of instances:
....
PUT /v2/apps/{app_id}
{
  "instances": 3
}
....

==== Idempotent requests

NOTE: Marathon will ignore multiple POST request to launch the same application

==== Upgrading an application

Marathon uses BLUE/GREEN approach during application upgrade sequence. It launches
a duplicate cluster of the application instances. So you need to have available
DOUBLE capacity in your cluster to accommodate and upgrade.

If your application is running 3 instances and you have a constraint to run
an instance on a unique host, you're going to have additional 3 hosts available
in your infrastructure to execute an upgrade:

Upgrade is executed with PUT command (change a Docker image version):
....
PUT /v2/apps/app_id
{
  "id": "app_id",
  ...
}
....

== See it

TIP: Now you can go a try to kill a running application - Mesos will notify
Marathon about an instance loss and Marathon will reschedule the task. This
"dance" ensures that your application instance will always be running.
